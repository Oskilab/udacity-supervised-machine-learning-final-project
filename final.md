The best guess price for the given feature set: [11.95, 0.00, 18.100, 0, 0.6590, 5.6090, 90.00, 1.385, 24, 680.0, 20.20, 332.09, 12.13]. You will find the best guess price for a particular model. Justify why you chose that model. Than predict the best guess and calculate variance on the price on that particular model (You can calculate variance by finding the prediction of the above feature set when you vary model complexity for this model).





grid search all models
retrain on all data
find prediction



Convince a layman that your guess is accurate. Given an argument in 2-3 sentences.



Convince your Udacity coach that your guess is accurate. You can do this by doing the following:

    Look at the model complexity graphs of DT, kNN, NNs and Boosting. In each case analyze the behavior of the training and test error curves and find out which model best generalizes the dataset. Provide a 2-3 sentence explanation for each graph.

    Find out if the best model you found in 1.1.3.1 suffers from a high bias or variance. To answer this, perform learning curve experiments for the best model you found for DT, kNN, NN and Boosting each. Analyze the training and test error curves for each in 2-3 sentences.
